This talk discussed our work on extracting medications from clinical records and combine it with new approaches 
to understand the reason for giving these drugs out of raw clinical text using Natural Language Processing. This system is applied to VetCompass to help us understand what antibiotics are being given and why on a population level but can also be applied to individual practices without having to read the clinical records themselves. This lecture will discuss how the model works, how to apply it and results on a population-level.
