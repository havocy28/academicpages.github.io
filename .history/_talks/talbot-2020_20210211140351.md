We have developed a system to built on previous work on extracting
medications from clinical records and combine it with new approaches
to understand the reason for giving these drugs out of raw clinical text
using Natural Language Processing. This system is applied to
VetCompass to help us understand what antibiotics are being given and
why on a population level but can also be applied to individual practices
without having to read the clinical records themselves. This lecture will
discuss how the model works, how to apply it and results on a
population-level.
