I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne doing a joint PhD in the fields of Natural Language Processing and Veterinary Epidemiology. My research interests fall within the fields of Natural Language Processing, Clinical Informatics and Machine Learning.  I am more specifically interested in exploiting structured and unstructured data to help machines understand the treatments given, the reasons behind them and using this data to help inform [Antimicrobial Stewardship Programs in Australia](https://www.ncas-australia.org/) to combat Antibiotic Resistance.

News
======
* Grant funding from [Australian Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/news/new-data-projects-will-help-transform-australian-research/) for expansion of [VetCompass Australia](https://www.vetcompass.com.au/) to develop the world's first platform to gather data from veterinary hospitals and veterinary pathology labs on national scale.  A major component of this project is building an infrastructure to enable the NLP models we created to be applied to help researchers around the world.
* Our [Veterinary Record Paper](https://bvajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1136/vr.105997) describes the usage of Cefovecin in veterinary practices accross Australia.  Cefovecin is a 3rd generation cephlasporin and [crtically important antibiotic](https://www.amr.gov.au/resources/importance-ratings-and-summary-antibacterial-uses-human-and-animal-health-australia) in terms of antibiotic resistance. We used our previous algorithms to generate the labels for this study and used this study to generate training data for our [BioNLP paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.bionlp-1.17/).
* [Antimicrobial Prescribing Guidelines](https://vetantibiotics.fvas.unimelb.edu.au/about/resources/) made available online for veterinarians in Companion Animal Practice.
* Our paper for [BioNLP @ ACL 2020 paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.bionlp-1.17/) was published.  In this paper we use instance selection and developed [VetBERT](https://github.com/havocy28/VetBERT) to minimize the amount of labels required to train a model to classify the reason for an antimicrobial administration.

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
