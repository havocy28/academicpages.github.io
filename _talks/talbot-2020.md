This talk discussed our work with [VetCompass Australia](https://www.vetcompass.com.au/) in extracting medications and the reason for administration from clinical records. Our work demonstrates an end to end approach using artificial intelligence to understand the reason for giving these drugs out of raw clinical text on a population level.  This is done through a combination of big data, rules-based algorithms and novel deep learning models.
